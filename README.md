## Interpolating Neural Network

This is the github repo for the paper ["Interpolating neural network (INN): A novel unification of machine learning and interpolation theory"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10296).

INN is a lightweight yet precise network architecture that can replace MLPs for data training, partial differential equation (PDE) solving, and parameter calibration. The key features of INNs are:

* Less trainable parameters than MLP without sacrificing accuracy
* Faster and proven convergent behavior
* Fully differntiable and GPU-optimized
